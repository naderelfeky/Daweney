The problem we hope to solve

Some people have difficulty finding a nurse or a doctor to take care of
them during the treatment period, and from here the idea of ​​​​the
application came to us, which is a system that the patient logs in to and
when is allowed to enter, he will find a very wide range of medical
services such as analyzes, x-rays, etc..
He can also ask a service provider such as a &quot;nurse&quot; to take care of him,
then the application will do its job and show him the available people who
provide the same service to him according to the price, the distance and
the job he will perform, and through that, the patient pays through the
various payment methods provided by the application, and from here we
may have solved the problem properly.

(i) approach and tools/techniques
In order to make it more flexible and easier for the patient, so that he can
reach us easily, we designed a website that can be accessed through the
browser and an application that can be accessed from the store

(ii) overview of system modules
There are two types of application, an application for the patient and an
application for the nurse or doctor. The patient application helps the
patient to request the service. So we come to the role of the nurse. The
service will reach him. Either I reject it or he accepts it. If he accepts, he
communicates with the patient and performs the service. And he can
control it
